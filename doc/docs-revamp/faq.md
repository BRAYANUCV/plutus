Draft FAQ for Plutus Core Plutus Tx

Stage 1: Identify and refine the questions

QUESTION TO ALL REVIEWERS: Can you think of questions that haven’t been included here yet that are likely to be on the minds of people who are coming to the documentation for the very first time? 

Stage 2: Develop answers to the questions

Below is a draft list of questions for consideration and review. Please add to the list if you have more suggestions, and edit/comment if a question should be clarified or modified to make more sense. 

Once we have reviewed and more or less settled on the questions, I’ll schedule a meeting inviting anyone who is available and interested to collect your thoughts to help inform the answers. Then I’ll circulate another draft that includes answers for review.
